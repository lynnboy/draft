\infannex{limits}{Implementation quantities}

\begin{paras}

\pnum
Because computers are finite, \Cpp  implementations are inevitably
limited in the size of the programs they can successfully process.
Every implementation shall
document those limitations where known.
This documentation may cite fixed limits where they
exist, say how to compute variable limits as a function
of available resources, or say that fixed limits do not exist
or are unknown.

\pnum
The limits may constrain quantities
that include those described below or others.
The bracketed number following each quantity is recommended
as the minimum for that quantity.
However, these quantities are only guidelines and do not determine compliance.
